# cruise-ships-gui :passenger_ship:

A Project for the Command Shift Software Engineering Bootcamp OOP module, using vanilla javascript.

The program contains 3 modules (Port, Itinerary and Ship), which pass information to each other through a Controller, 
making it possible to build itineraries, set sail and dock at subsequent ports. I've added a couple of my own additions, 
like keeping track of passengers coming aboard and disembarking.  

:construction:

This iteration will eventually render the ports and ships in the browser, taking user input to build the itinerary. :eyes:
